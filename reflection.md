The goal of our redesigned Picture library was to make it easer to compose
operations without having to load and save an image each time. We accomplished
that goal, now it's time for critique. In this round of critique we're focusing
on the following question:

Is there anything that is still annoying or difficult about the operations we
have in the library (i.e., flipping, rotating, and grayscaling)?

I still felt like the code itself is strenuous to understand, and I still felt like a lot of the program can be simplified in the sense that a lot of the code are "repeated".
