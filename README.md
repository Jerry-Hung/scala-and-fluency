## TODOS for Ben
   - Give credit somewhere: http://otfried.org/scala/image.html
   - Write the README file (with a pointer to wiki, plus a checklist)
   - Host the docs on readthedocs
   - In a separate (gitted) directory, work forward, focusing on the things that
     will make it less annoying: imports, naming, nesting _vs_ chaining,
     operators (incl. associativity and precedence), literal extension, closures
     (as part of implementation of convolution?).
   
## Assignment   
   - Rework the Picture library
      - Do I provide the design, or let them design it? If we can get to design
        in class, that's best.
      - Have them define an image op (maybe optional)

### ScalaTest
   - [Setting up in intelliJ](https://docs.scala-lang.org/getting-started-intellij-track/testing-scala-in-intellij-with-scalatest.html)

## Future
  - curried (or just higher-order) functions as a way to pass arguments to filters
